## Installation

To use the enhanced bashrc:

1. Back up your current bashrc:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.backup
   ```

2. Replace your current bashrc with the enhanced version:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/enhanced_bashrc.sh ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Source the new bashrc:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

## Configuration Options

The enhanced bashrc includes many configuration options that can be customized by setting environment variables before sourcing the bashrc or by editing the CONFIG array in the file:

```bash
# Example: Disable lazy loading in your ~/.bashrc.precustom
export U_LAZY_LOAD=0
```

Key configuration options include:

- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (0=off, 1=on)
- `LAZY_LOAD`: Lazy load heavy components (0=off, 1=on)
- `CACHE_PROMPT`: Cache prompt components (0=off, 1=on)
- `SECURE_UPDATES`: Check for security updates (0=off, 1=on)
- `HIST_CONTEXT`: Store directory context with history (0=off, 1=on)
- `COMMAND_TIMING`: Show execution time for commands (0=off, 1=on)
- `SMART_PROMPT`: Adjust prompt based on terminal width (0=off, 1=on)
- `ENHANCED_CD`: Enhanced directory navigation (0=off, 1=on)

## New Features

### Enhanced Prompt

The prompt now includes:

- Command execution time
- Git branch, status, stash count, and upstream status
- Security indicators for SSH and sudo sessions
- Exit status of previous command
- Job count indicator
- Adaptive sizing based on terminal width

### Directory Navigation

Enhanced `cd` command with:

- Directory stack manipulation (`cd --` to show stack, `cd -N` to go to Nth directory)
- Auto-listing of directory contents after changing directories
- Shorthand for common operations (`cd -` for previous, `cd +dir` to push to stack)

### Bookmarks with Fuzzy Matching

The `j` command allows you to bookmark and jump to directories:

- `j -a` to add current directory to bookmarks
- `j -l` to list bookmarks
- `j -r N` to remove bookmark number N
- `j N` to jump to bookmark number N
- `j pattern` to fuzzy search bookmarks

### Security Tools

New security features include:

- `checksec file` to check file security properties
- `securerm file` to securely delete files
- `check_file_integrity file` to verify file integrity
- `update_file_integrity dir` to update integrity database
- Automatic security update notifications

### System Monitoring

New monitoring tools:

- `sysmon [delay] [count]` to monitor system resources
- `findlarge [size] [count]` to find large files
- `findempty` to find empty directories
- `check_security_updates` to check for security updates

### Development Tools

Improved development environment support:

- Lazy loading of Pyenv, NVM, RVM, and Cargo
- Enhanced Git aliases and functions
- Simple HTTP server with `serve [port]`
- Password generation with `genpass [length]`

## Performance Improvements

The enhanced bashrc includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Development environments are only loaded when needed
2. **Prompt Caching**: Git status information is cached to reduce command execution
3. **Completion Optimization**: Programmable completion is loaded on first Tab press
4. **Path Sanitization**: PATH is cleaned of duplicates and invalid entries
5. **Conditional Execution**: Heavy operations are only performed when necessary

## Customization

The bashrc is designed to be easily customizable:

- `~/.bashrc.precustom`: Loaded at the beginning for early customization
- `~/.bashrc.postcustom`: Loaded at the end for overriding defaults
- `~/.bash_aliases`: For custom aliases
- `~/.bash_functions`: For custom functions
- `~/.bash_aliases.d/`: Directory for organizing aliases by category
- `~/.bash_functions.d/`: Directory for organizing functions by category
- `~/.bash_modules.d/`: Directory for modular extensions

## Module System

The enhanced bashrc includes a module system for organizing and loading extensions:

- `module_enable name` to enable a module
- `module_disable name` to disable a module
- `module_list` to list available modules

Modules are stored in `~/.bash_modules.d/` as shell scripts.

## Help and Documentation

Type `help-sentinel` to see a list of available commands and features.

## Compatibility

The enhanced bashrc is designed to work across different Linux distributions and versions of Bash. It includes detection and adaptation for:

- Different package managers (apt, dnf, yum, pacman)
- Different terminal capabilities
- Presence or absence of various utilities

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Enable debug mode: `export U_DEBUG=1` before sourcing
2. Check the profile output: `export BASHRC_PROFILE=1` before sourcing
3. Disable features incrementally to isolate problems
4. Check for error messages in the console output
