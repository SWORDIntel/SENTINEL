# Index of External Git Readmes

This section refers to a collection of README files from various external Git repositories that are stored within the SENTINEL project's `gitstar/readmes/` directory.

These files are typically from projects that are relevant to, inspire, or are dependencies/tools used by SENTINEL. They form part of the project's knowledge base.

**Location:** `gitstar/readmes/`

Due to the large number of these external READMEs, they are **not duplicated** into this `docs/` directory. Please refer to the original `gitstar/readmes/` path to browse them.

The files `gitstar/readmes/auto_sort.md` and `gitstar/readmes/UNSORTED/progress.md` (located within the `gitstar/readmes/` directory itself) provide information on how these readmes are curated and organized.
