# BLE.sh Removal Notes

## Summary
BLE.sh (Bash Line Editor) is being phased out from SENTINEL. This document tracks the changes made to remove BLE.sh integration warnings.

## Changes Made (2025-07-11)

### 1. Updated fzf.module
The FZF module was showing warnings about BLE.sh not being loaded. The following changes were made:

- **BLE.sh Check**: Modified to only check for BLE.sh when `SENTINEL_VERBOSE=1` is set
- **Warning Removal**: Removed the "BLE.sh not loaded" warning that appeared during normal startup
- **FZF Integration**: Updated to only attempt BLE.sh FZF integration if BLE.sh is actually loaded
- **Logging**: Removed BLE.sh version from FZF module logging

### 2. Impact
- No more BLE.sh warnings during startup
- FZF continues to work normally without BLE.sh
- BLE.sh functionality can still be accessed if verbose mode is enabled

### 3. Files Modified
- `/opt/github/SENTINEL/bash_modules.d/fzf.module`

### 4. Related Components
- BLE.sh is still installed at `~/.local/share/blesh/`
- The `blesh_loader.sh` script still exists at `~/blesh_loader.sh`
- The autocomplete module already has BLE.sh functionality disabled

### 5. Future Considerations
- Complete removal of BLE.sh installation from install.sh
- Remove blesh_loader.sh from the installation process
- Update documentation to reflect BLE.sh removal
- Consider alternative autocomplete solutions if needed
