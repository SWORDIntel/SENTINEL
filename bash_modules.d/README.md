## Modules Subsystem
The modules subsystem is designed to provide modules which can be dynamically loaded
to alter the bash environment based on the task at hand. For example, a module could
be created that alters the prompt, aliases, etc. for working with 


### Module Format / Requirements
Modules use regular bash syntax, but must meet certain requirements:
 
 * Modules must end in .module
 * Modules must be include a header like the one below:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# SENTINEL Module System Enhancement Report

## User: John
## Date: 2023-11-25 10:15:04 UTC

### Progress Summary
✅ Analyzed existing SENTINEL module system

✅ Identified key improvement opportunities

✅ Developed enhanced SENTINEL 3.0 implementation

✅ Created module template format

✅ Documented implementation guide

### Key Enhancements
- Combined best features from both systems
- Added integrity verification with SHA256 hashing
- Improved dependency resolution with cycle detection
- Added performance metrics and diagnostics
- Enhanced logging system
- Implemented better error handling
- Added backward compatibility

### Next Steps
1. Migrate existing modules to new format(NB:MITIGATED)
2. Update module hashes for integrity verification
3. Test dependency resolution with complex module trees
4. Consider adding a module repository feature
5. Implement automated testing for modules
