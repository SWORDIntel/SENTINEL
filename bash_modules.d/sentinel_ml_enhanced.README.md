# Module: sentinel_ml_enhanced

## Purpose
This module provides the enhanced machine learning features of SENTINEL. It is responsible for training and running the machine learning models that power the intelligent suggestion features.

## Dependencies
- Required: `logging`, `python_integration`
- Optional: `tensorflow`

## Functions Exported
- `sentinel_ml_train`: Trains the machine learning models.
- `sentinel_ml_predict`: Makes a prediction using the machine learning models.

## Configuration
- `SENTINEL_ENABLE_TENSORFLOW`: A flag to enable or disable the use of TensorFlow for deep learning models.

## Security Notes
- This module can be resource-intensive, especially when training the machine learning models. It is recommended to run it on a machine with a powerful CPU and a lot of RAM.

## Examples
```bash
# Train the machine learning models
sentinel_ml_train

# Make a prediction
sentinel_ml_predict "git"
```
