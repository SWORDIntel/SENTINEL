# SENTINEL: Secure ENhanced Terminal INtelligent Layer

![SENTINEL Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/0d1117/30a14e?text=SENTINEL)

A hardened, optimized, security-focused shell environment for advanced users, researchers, and security professionals, featuring intelligent context-aware assistance, comprehensive autocomplete, environment management, and cybersecurity capabilities.

## Core Features

- **Comprehensive Security**: HMAC verification for module integrity, permission hardening, and execution sandboxing.
- **Intelligent Command Prediction**: Context-aware suggestions based on history analysis, project context, and statistical modeling.
- **Enhanced Autocomplete**: A hybrid system providing robust autocompletion for commands, arguments, and file paths.
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Automatic Python virtual environment detection, switching, and dependency tracking.
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, dependency-based module system, and caching to maintain a responsive terminal.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

# Run the installer
bash install.sh

# Restart your shell or source the configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

The installer will guide you through the installation process. It will check for dependencies, create the necessary directory structure, and patch your `~/.bashrc` file.

## Configuration

SENTINEL is configured using a YAML file. By default, it will look for a `config.yaml` file in the root of the repository. If it doesn't find one, it will use the `config.yaml.dist` file as a fallback.

To customize your installation, you can copy `config.yaml.dist` to `config.yaml` and modify it to your needs.

The configuration file allows you to:
-   Enable or disable modules.
-   Configure Python environment settings.
-   Set security verification options.
-   Configure logging levels and locations.

For more information on the available configuration options, please see the `config.yaml.dist` file.

## Usage Examples

### Intelligent Command Completion

Type a partial command and press Tab to see context-aware suggestions:
```
$ git ch<TAB>
checkout  cherry-pick  cherry  check-ignore  check-mailmap  check-ref-format
```

With deep completion for arguments and options:
```
$ git checkout <TAB>
main   feature/auth   hotfix/ssl-fix   v2.3.0-RC1   remotes/origin/main
```

### Command Prediction

The system learns from your workflow patterns:
```
$ cd project/
Suggestions based on context:
  npm run dev
  git status
  code .
```

## Troubleshooting

-   Check the logs in `~/logs/` for any errors.
-   Run the installer again with the `--non-interactive` flag to see the full output.
-   If you are having issues with a specific module, you can disable it in your `config.yaml` file.
