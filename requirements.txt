# Security notes:
# - All dependencies should be kept up to date and reviewed for CVEs (see CVE-2023-4863, CVE-2023-49103, etc.)
# - Use a virtual environment for isolation and reproducibility
# - For GPU/accelerated LLM, see llama-cpp-python docs
# - For advanced OSINT, consider additional modules as needed
# - Always keep dependencies up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities (see CVE-2023-4863, CVE-2023-49103, etc.)
# - For GPU acceleration with llama-cpp-python, see its documentation for CUDA/ROCm requirements
# - If using Windows, consider alternatives for 'readline' or use pyreadline3
