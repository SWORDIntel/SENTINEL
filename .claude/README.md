## Quick Start for AI Assistants

1. **Understanding the Project**: Start with `context/project_overview.md`
2. **Current State**: Review `context/current_state.md` for what's implemented
3. **Making Changes**: Follow guides in `guides/` directory
4. **Architecture**: Understand the system via `architecture/system_design.md`
5. **Best Practices**: Review `knowledge/best_practices.md` before making changes

## Key Principles

1. **Modularity**: Everything is a module - see `architecture/module_system.md`
2. **Security First**: All changes must consider security - see `architecture/security_model.md`
3. **Performance**: Bash startup time is critical - see `architecture/performance.md`
4. **Compatibility**: Must work on various Linux distributions
5. **Documentation**: Every feature must be documented

## Common Tasks

- **Adding a Module**: Use `templates/module_template.module` and follow `guides/module_development.md`
- **Adding Python Tool**: Use `templates/python_tool_template.py` and follow `guides/python_integration.md`
- **Fixing Issues**: Check `knowledge/troubleshooting.md` first
- **Testing Changes**: Follow `guides/testing_guide.md`

## Important Files to Know

- `install.sh` - Main installation script (be very careful with changes)
- `bash_modules` - Core module loading system
- `bashrc.postcustom` - Where user customizations are loaded
- `sentinel_postinstall_check.sh` - Verification script (run after changes)

## Development Workflow

1. Understand the context (this directory)
2. Make changes following the guides
3. Test thoroughly using provided test scripts
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Run `sentinel_postinstall_check.sh` to verify
