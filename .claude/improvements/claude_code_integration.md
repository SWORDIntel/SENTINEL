  - "Generate API documentation from code"
```

## Technical Architecture

### MCP Server Implementation

```python
# sentinel_mcp_server.py
class SentinelMCPServer:
    """MCP server for Claude Code integration"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.command_executor = CommandExecutor()
        self.context_manager = ContextManager()
        self.security_sandbox = SecuritySandbox()
    
    async def handle_request(self, request):
        """Handle Claude Code requests"""
        # Validate and sandbox the request
        validated = self.security_sandbox.validate(request)
        
        # Execute with context
        result = await self.command_executor.execute(
            validated.command,
            context=self.context_manager.get_context()
        )
        
        # Update context and return
        self.context_manager.update(result)
        return self.format_response(result)
```

### Context Sharing

```yaml
Shared Context:
  - Current directory and project type
  - Active SENTINEL modules
  - Recent command history
  - System state and resources
  - Security posture
  - User preferences

Context Flow:
  1. SENTINEL maintains real-time context
  2. Context streamed to Claude via MCP
  3. Claude uses context for better suggestions
  4. Commands executed with full context awareness
```

### Security Model

```yaml
Security Layers:
  1. Command Validation:
     - Syntax checking
     - Permission verification
     - Resource limits
     
  2. Sandboxing:
     - Isolated execution environment
     - Network restrictions
     - File system boundaries
     
  3. Audit Trail:
     - All commands logged
     - Claude requests tracked
     - Security events recorded
     
  4. User Confirmation:
     - Dangerous operations require approval
     - Batch operations summarized
     - Rollback capabilities
```

## Use Case Examples

### 1. Security Incident Response

```bash
User: "Claude, investigate the suspicious activity on port 8080"

Claude + SENTINEL:
1. Analyzes network connections on port 8080
2. Identifies suspicious patterns
3. Traces process ownership
4. Checks against threat intelligence
5. Generates incident report
6. Suggests remediation steps
7. Optionally executes fixes with approval
```

### 2. Development Environment Setup

```bash
User: "Set up a secure development environment for our new API"

Claude + SENTINEL:
1. Detects project requirements
2. Sets up virtual environment
3. Installs dependencies with security scanning
4. Configures pre-commit hooks
5. Sets up testing framework
6. Creates CI/CD templates
7. Implements security best practices
```

### 3. System Optimization

```bash
User: "Optimize system performance, it's running slow"

Claude + SENTINEL:
1. Analyzes system resources
2. Identifies bottlenecks
3. Suggests optimizations
4. Implements approved changes
5. Monitors improvements
6. Adjusts based on results
```

### 4. OSINT Investigation

```bash
User: "Gather information about domain example.com"

Claude + SENTINEL:
1. DNS enumeration
2. Certificate transparency logs
3. Web technology detection
4. Social media correlation
5. Threat intelligence lookup
6. Generate comprehensive report
```
