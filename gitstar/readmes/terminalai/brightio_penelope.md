Penelope is a powerful shell handler built to simplify, accelerate, and optimize post-exploitation workflows.

- It runs on all Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD etc)
- Requires **Python 3.6+**
- It is **standalone** as it uses only Python’s standard library.

## Install

Penelope requires no installation - just download and execute the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brightio/penelope/refs/heads/main/penelope.py && python3 penelope.py
```
For a more streamlined setup, it can be installed using:
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/brightio/penelope
```

### Global Features
- Streamline interaction with the targets via modules
- Multiple sessions
- Multiple listeners
- Serve files/folders via HTTP (-s switch)
- Can be imported by python3 exploits and get shell on the same terminal (see [Extras](#Extras))

### Modules

Penelope can work in conjunction with metasploit exploits by disabling the default handler with `set DisablePayloadHandler True`

## Usage
### Sample Typical Usage
```
penelope                   # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:4444
penelope -a                # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:4444 and show reverse shell payloads based on the current Listeners
penelope 5555              # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:5555
penelope 5555 -i eth0      # Listening for reverse shells on eth0:5555
penelope 1111 2222 3333    # Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0:1111, 0.0.0.0:2222, 0.0.0.0:3333
penelope -c target 3333    # Connect to a bind shell on target:3333
```

### Demonstrating Random Usage

As shown in the below video, within only a few seconds we have easily:
1. A fully functional auto-resizable PTY shell while logging every interaction with the target
2. Execute the lastest version of Linpeas on the target without touching the disk and get the output on a local file in realtime 
3. One more PTY shell in another tab
4. Uploaded the latest versions of LinPEAS and linux-smart-enumeration
5. Uploaded a local folder with custom scripts
6. Uploaded an exploit-db exploit directly from URL
7. Downloaded and opened locally a remote file
8. Downloaded the remote /etc directory
9. For every shell that may be killed for some reason, automatically a new one is spawned. This gives us a kind of persistence with the target

### Main Menu Commands
Some Notes:
- By default you need to press `F12` to detach the PTY shell and go to the Main Menu. If the upgrade was not possible the you ended up with a basic shell, you can detach it with `Ctrl+C`. This also prevents the accidental killing of the shell.
- The Main Menu supports TAB completion and also short commands. For example instead of `interact 1` you can just type `i 1`.

Your contributions are invaluable! If you’d like to help, please report bugs, unexpected behaviors, or share new ideas. You can also submit pull requests but avoid making commits from IDEs that enforce PEP8 and unintentionally restructure the entire codebase.

## TODO

### Features
* remote port forwarding
* socks & http proxy
* persistence modules
* team server
* currently spawn/script/portfwd commands are supported only on Unix shells. Those need to be implemented for Windows shells too.
* an option switch for disable all logging, not only sessions.
* main menu autocompletion for short commands
* download/upload autocompletion
* IPv6 support
* encryption
* UDP support

### Known Issues
* Main menu: Ctrl-C on main menu has not the expected behavior yet.
* Session logging: when executing commands on the target that feature alternate buffers like nano and they are abnormally terminated, then when 'catting' the logfile it seems corrupted. However the data are still there. Also for example when resetting the remote terminal, these escape sequences are reflected in the logs. I will need to filter specific escape sequences so as to ensure that when 'catting' the logfile, a smooth log is presented.

## Trivia
Penelope was the wife of Odysseus and she is known for her fidelity for him by waiting years. Since a characteristic of reverse shell handlers is waiting, this tool is named after her.
