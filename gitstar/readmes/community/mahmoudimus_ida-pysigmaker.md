# ida-pysigmaker

An IDA Pro 9.0+ cross-platform port of @A200K's [IDA-Pro-SigMaker](https://github.com/A200K/IDA-Pro-SigMaker) to Python. Works on MacOS/Linux/Windows.

Signature Maker Plugin for IDA Pro 9.0+

## Requirements
- IDA Python
- Python 3

## Installation

This python port of sigmaker's main value proposition is its cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) Python 3 support. It takes zero third party dependencies, making the code both portable and easy to install.

- Copy `sigmaker.py` into the /plugins/ folder to the plugin directory!
- Restart your disassembler.

That's it!

### Need to find your plugin directory?

From IDA's Python console run the following command to find its plugin directory:
```python
import idaapi, os; print(os.path.join(idaapi.get_user_idadir(), "plugins"))
```

### Where and what is my default user directory?
The user directory is a location where IDA stores some of the global settings and which can be used for some additional customization. 
Default location:
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Hex-Rays/IDA Pro`
- On Linux and Mac: `$HOME/.idapro`

## Usage
In disassembly view, select a line you want to generate a signature for, and press 
**CTRL+ALT+S**

### Signature searching
Searching for Signatures works for supported formats:

Just enter any string containing your Signature, it will automatically try to figure out what kind of Signature format is being used:

Currently, all output formats you can generate are supported.

Match(es) of your signature will be printed to console:
