# Macchina-J2534
J2534 drivers for various Macchina hardware

This is a experimental driver which is built in Rust, and is unofficially ported to Linux and OSX as well as Windows.

The Linux and OSX port can be utilized by [OpenVehicleDiag](https://github.com/rnd-ash/OpenVehicleDiag)

## Feature matrix

:x: - Feature is not supported by the adapter

TODO - Feature is supported by the adapter, but work is needed on the driver side in order to utilize it

:heavy_minus_sign: - Feature works, however some parts of the full implementation are missing, so some bugs might exist

✔️ - Feature works fully according to the J2534 specification

## How to install

The process is generally the same for all supported hardware.

### Requirments
* Rust installed on your system [See here on how to](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Arduino IDE Installed [See here on how to](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Important information for windows users
You will need to install the i686-pc-windows-msvc toolchain!
```
$ rustup run stable-i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

### Linux users
You need to install `libudev-dev` prior to building!

### Installing the driver on Windows
1. Create the directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\macchina\passthru\`
2. Give the created `passthru` directory write permissions for your user account
3. From the repositories driver folder, run `build.bat`. This will compile and install the drive
4. Open `WIN_DRIVER.reg` and modify the COM-PORT attributes in the reg file to match that of your adapter as listed in device manager
5. Merge the `WIN_DRIVER.reg` file with the Windows registry

### Installing the driver on Linux and OSX
1. Create the directory `~/.passthru/`
2. From the repositories driver folder, run `build.sh`
3. In your `~/.passthru/` folder, you will find 2 JSON files. One for the M2 (`macchina_m2.json`) and one for the A0 (`macchina_a0.json`). Change the `COM-PORT` attribute in the JSON to match that of your TTY port your adapter uses.

### Installing the adapter firmware
1. Install [FlexLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) and [esp32_can](https://github.com/collin80/esp32_can) libraries (instructions are on the repo links)
2. be sure you have read the setting up docs for your relivent adapter on Macchina's website [here for the A0](https://docs.macchina.cc/a0-docs/getting-started) or [here for the M2](https://docs.macchina.cc/m2-docs/arduino).
3. Open the firmware folder in Arduino IDE
4. Modify `MACCHINA_CONFIG.h`, such that the file looks like the following depending on your target device:

For A0
```cpp
//#define CFG_MACCHINA_M2
#define CFG_MACCHINA_A0
//#define CFG_MACCHINA_ESP32_TEST
```

For M2
```cpp
#define CFG_MACCHINA_M2
//#define CFG_MACCHINA_A0
//#define CFG_MACCHINA_ESP32_TEST
```

5. Upload the sketch to your target board and enjoy! On both the A0 and M2, a red LED will be activated upon successful upload. This means the adapter is ready to be used!
