## ü§î What is this sorcery?

DarkFlare is a clever little tool that disguises your TCP traffic as innocent HTTPS requests, letting them pass through corporate firewalls like a VIP at a nightclub. It's like a tunnel, but with more style and less dirt.

It has two parts: a client-side proxy (darkflare-client) that encodes TCP data into HTTPS requests and sends it to a Cloudflare-protected domain, and a server-side proxy (darkflare-server) that decodes the requests and forwards the data to a local service (like SSH on port 22). It‚Äôs protocol-agnostic, secure, and uses Cloudflare's encrypted infrastructure, making it stealthy and scalable for accessing internal resources or bypassing network restrictions.

When using this remember the traffic over the tunnel is only as secure as the Cloudflare protection. Use your own encryption.

## üß± Why CDNs?
Services like Cloudflare, Akamai Technologies, Fastly, and Amazon CloudFront are not only widely accessible but also integral to the global internet infrastructure. In regions with restrictive networks, alternatives such as CDNetworks in Russia, ArvanCloud in Iran, or ChinaCache in China may serve as viable proxies. These CDNs support millions of websites across critical sectors, including government and healthcare, making them indispensable. Blocking them risks significant collateral damage, which inadvertently makes them reliable pathways for bypassing restrictions.

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Stop Network Censorship
Internet censorship is a significant issue in many countries, where governments restrict access to information by blocking websites and services. For instance, China employs the "Great Firewall" to block platforms like Facebook and Twitter, while Iran restricts access to social media and messaging apps. In Russia, authorities have intensified efforts to control information flow by blocking virtual private networks (VPNs) and other tools that citizens use to bypass censorship.

AP NEWS
 In such environments, a tool that tunnels TCP traffic over HTTP(S) through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Cloudflare can be invaluable. By disguising restricted traffic as regular web traffic, this method can effectively circumvent censorship measures, granting users access to blocked content and preserving the free flow of information.

4. Unwrapped back to TCP ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Target Service
```

### CA Root Notes
In some cases the direct server might fail TLS. If that happens you can use the CDN server or make sure you have the CA certs:

For Debian-based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu)

   sudo apt install ca-certificates

For Red Hat-based Systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora)

   sudo yum install ca-certificates



##  Usecases
ssh, rdp, or anything tcp to bypass restrictive firewalls or state controled internet.

Tunneling ppp or other vpn services that leverage TCP.

darkflare-server can launch applications like sshd or pppd. Note that there are issues with host keys and certificate validation on sshd if you don't configure it properly.

Linux's popular pppd daemon will also not run as non-root in some cases, which would require a more complex configuration with sudo.

[How to use NordVPN over TCP](https://support.nordvpn.com/hc/en-us/articles/19683394518161-OpenVPN-connection-on-NordVPN#:~:text=With%20NordVPN%2C%20you%20can%20connect,differences%20between%20TCP%20and%20UDP. "Configure NordVPN over TCP")

## NordVPN

1. Download the OpenVPN client (cli is better) 
2. Under Manual setup in your NordVPN web account download the .ovpn file for TCP
3. Also in Manual setup select username and password authentication.
4. Edit the .ovpn file and change the IP and port to your darkflare server IP and Port.
5. Configure darkflare-server to use the IP and port defined in the .ovpn file.
6. Import the .ovpn file to OpenVPN and setup your username and password.

I did provide an ./examples/nordvpn.ovpn for you to use. Also two scrips for up/down to fix some of the routing issues.

Using the OpenVPN commandline client you can embed the username, password, and it runs the scripts properly for you:
```
& openvpn --config 127.0.0.1.tcp2222.ovpn --script-security 2
```

Note: OpenVPN by default screws up the default gateway/route. For testing purposes I added: pull-filter ignore "redirect-gateway" to the .ovpn file. That allows me to force the tunnel to not change the routing. The routing can be fixed by the OpenVPN-up.sh and OpenVPN-down.sh scripts. This is due to the fact that the VPN is connecting to the whole CDN range of IP addresses. 


## üîê Few Obscureation Techniques

Requests are randomized to look like normal web traffic with jpg, php, etc... with random file names.

Client and server headers are set to look like normal web traffic. 

If you have other ideas please send them my way.


## üå©Ô∏è Cloudflare Configuration 
Add your new proxy hostname into a free Cloudflare account.

Setup your origin rules to send that host to the origin server (darkflare-server) via the proxy port you choose. 

## ‚ú® Features

- **Sneaky TCP Tunneling**: Wraps your TCP connections in a fashionable HTTPS outfit
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Because who doesn't want their traffic to look like it's just visiting Cloudflare?
- **Debug Mode**: For when things go wrong and you need to know why (spoiler: it's always DNS)
- **Session Management**: Keeps your connections organized like a Type A personality
- **TLS Security**: Because we're sneaky, not reckless
- **Client-controlled destination addressing**: The destination (-d) is now specified on the client side and securely transmitted to the server. This can be overridden by the server command -override-dest.
- **Base64 encoded destination transmission**: The server no longer requires a destination parameter (-d has been removed)
- **Reverse Proxy Support**: The client now supports SOCKS5 and HTTP(s) proxies via the -p flag on the client.
- **Custom 302**: Server now has defined 302 redirects for non-auth users.
- **stdin:stdout**: stdin:stdout client mode for client to avoid firewall restrictions and binding to local ports.
- **Fileless Execution on Windows**: PowerShell script to execute the client without saving any files to disk.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/doxx/darkflare/releases)
   - Choose the appropriate binary for your system:
     - `darkflare-client-darwin-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon
     - `darkflare-client-darwin-amd64` - macOS Intel
     - `darkflare-client-linux-amd64` - Linux x64
     - `darkflare-client-windows-amd64.exe` - Windows x64
     - `darkflare-server-*` - corresponding server binaries
2. Verify the checksums against `checksums.txt` (recommended)
3. Make the binaries executable (Unix systems):
```bash
chmod +x darkflare-client-* darkflare-server-*
```

### Running the Client
```bash
./darkflare-client -l 2222 -t https://cdn.miami.us.doxx.net:443 -d <my ssh server>:22
```

Or with direct mode:
```bash
./darkflare-client -l 2222 -t https://direct.miami.us.doxx.net:443 -d <my ssh server>:22
```

Add `-debug` flag for debug mode

### Notes
If you want to debug and go directly to the psudo server you can use the `-allow-direct` flag on the server.

You can replace the doxx.net server with your own and setup your own server:

### Running the Server

```bash
# HTTPS Server (recommended for production)
./darkflare-server -o https://direct.miami.us.doxx.net:443 -c /path/to/cert.pem -k /path/to/key.pem

# HTTP Server (for testing)
./darkflare-server -o http://direct.miami.us.doxx.net:8080 -allow-direct
```

### Notes
- The `-allow-direct` flag allows direct connections without Cloudflare headers (not recommended for production)
- Debug mode (`-debug`) provides verbose logging of connections and data transfers
- Under SSL/TLS configuration in Cloudflare you need to set ssl encryption mode to Full.

### SSL/TLS Certificates

For HTTPS mode, you'll need to obtain origin certificates from Cloudflare:

1. Log into your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to SSL/TLS > Origin Server
3. Create a new certificate (or use an existing one)
4. Download both the certificate and private key
5. When starting the server in HTTPS mode, provide both certificate files:

Note: Keep your private key secure and never share it. The certificate provided by Cloudflare is specifically for securing the connection between Cloudflare and your origin server.

### Testing the Connection
```bash
ssh user@localhost -p 2222
```

## üîå stdin:stdout Client Mode

DarkFlare now supports stdin:stdout mode, allowing you to use the client without binding to local ports. This is particularly useful when:
- You don't have privileges to bind to local ports
- Local firewalls restrict port binding
- You want to integrate with SSH's ProxyCommand

### Using with SSH
The most common use case is with SSH's ProxyCommand. Add to your ~/.ssh/config:
```bash
Host my-remote
    HostName remote-server.example.com
    User myuser
    ProxyCommand darkflare-client -l stdin:stdout -t cdn.example.com -d localhost:22
```

Then simply connect:
```bash
ssh my-remote
```

Or use directly from the command line:
```bash
ssh -o ProxyCommand="darkflare-client -l stdin:stdout -t cdn.example.com -d localhost:22" user@remote-server
```

### Benefits
- No local port binding required
- Works without root/admin privileges
- Bypasses local firewall restrictions
- Integrates seamlessly with SSH and other tools
- Maintains end-to-end encryption
- Traffic still appears as normal HTTPS to observers

## üîÑ Advanced SSH Integration

### Understanding the Proxy Chain
DarkFlare can create a sophisticated proxy chain when using SSH ProxyCommand mode:

```
                     CORPORATE FIREWALL
                     |     |     |     |
                     v     v     v     v

[SSH Client]         [Optional Proxy]        [Cloudflare]         [Target]
    |                     |                      |                   |
    |                     |                      |                   |
    |   stdin/stdout      |       HTTPS          |      TCP          |
    | =================>  |  =================>  | =================>|
    |  darkflare-client   |    CDN Traffic       |  darkflare-server |
    |                     |                      |                   |
    |                     |                      |                   |
    
Flow:
1. SSH ‚îÄ‚îÄ> darkflare-client (via stdin/stdout)
2. darkflare-client ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Optional Proxy (SOCKS5/HTTP)
3. Proxy ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Cloudflare CDN
4. Cloudflare ‚îÄ‚îÄ> darkflare-server
5. darkflare-server ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Target SSH Server
```

### How It Works
1. **SSH ProxyCommand Integration**
   - Instead of binding to a local port (`-l 2222`), which can trigger firewalls
   - Uses `-l stdin:stdout` to communicate directly with SSH
   - Avoids all local TCP socket issues
   ```bash
   ssh -o ProxyCommand="darkflare-client -l stdin:stdout -t cdn.example.com -d localhost:22" user@remote
   ```

2. **Optional Proxy Support**
   - Use `-p` to specify an outbound proxy
   - Supports SOCKS5, HTTP, and HTTPS proxies
   - Optional authentication supported
   ```bash
   # Format: -p scheme://[user:pass@]host:port
   -p socks5://proxy.local:1080
   -p http://user:pass@proxy.local:3128
   ```

3. **Complete Example with Proxy**
   ```bash
   ssh -o ProxyCommand="darkflare-client -l stdin:stdout -t cdn.example.com -d localhost:22 -p socks5://proxy.local:1080" user@remote
   ```

### Benefits of This Approach
- **No Local Ports**: Avoids firewall restrictions on binding to ports
- **Proxy Flexibility**: Works with existing corporate proxies
- **Clean Traffic**: All external traffic looks like HTTPS to CDN
- **Authentication**: Supports proxy authentication when required
- **Firewall Friendly**: Operates entirely through allowed ports/protocols

### SSH Config Example
Add to your `~/.ssh/config` for persistent configuration:
```
Host remote-server
    HostName remote-server.example.com
    User myuser
    ProxyCommand darkflare-client -l stdin:stdout \
                                 -t cdn.example.com \
                                 -d localhost:22 \
                                 -p socks5://proxy.local:1080
```

Then simply:
```bash
ssh remote-server
```

## üîí Windows Fileless Execution

For scenarios requiring fileless operation on Windows systems, DarkFlare provides DLL variants that can be loaded directly into memory:

Location: `bin/dll/`
- `darkflare-client-windows-386.dll` (32-bit)
- `darkflare-client-windows-amd64.dll` (64-bit)

These DLLs can be embedded within C# or C++ applications for memory-only execution, making them suitable for situations where disk writes need to be avoided.

For implementation details and examples, see:
- [Embedding Golang Tools in C#/C++](https://medium.com/@shantanukhande/red-team-how-to-embed-golang-tools-in-c-e269bf33876a)

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This feature should only be used in legitimate testing scenarios with proper authorization.
