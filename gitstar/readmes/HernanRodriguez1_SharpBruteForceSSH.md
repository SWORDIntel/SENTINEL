# SharpBruteForceSSH
This is a simple SSH brute force tool written in C#. It is designed to perform dictionary-based brute force attacks on SSH services. The tool takes a target IP address, a list of usernames, and a list of passwords as input. It then attempts to authenticate using each combination of username and password until a successful login is found or all combinations have been exhausted.

## Features:

Supports multithreaded brute force attacks for faster execution.
Allows setting a delay between authentication attempts to avoid lockouts or rate limiting.
Provides an option to continue the brute force attack even after finding a valid username and password combination.
Retrieves the SSH server banner for target identification.
Written using the Renci.SshNet library for SSH communication.

## Compiled:

```sh
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe  /reference:Renci.SshNet.dll /out:SharpBruteForceSSH.exe .\SharpBruteForceSSH.cs

Added the option to validate the status of the service if it is available or not. Example of SSH service turned off or IP blocking in the middle of a brute force process
