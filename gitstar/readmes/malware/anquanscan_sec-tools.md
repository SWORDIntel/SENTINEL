[Smart-Augmented-Glasses-Hackthon-4.0-](https://github.com/phanisaikamal/Smart-Augmented-Glasses-Hackthon-4.0-): Smart Glasses for Police Force, a wearable augmented reality glasses with applications in security, medical and industrial field applications such as remote monitoring surgical operations. Our solution is built with state of the art IOT components integrated with Artificial Intelligence. The glasses essentially automate the process of asking for an ID. When the wearer looks at someone, the attached camera apparently takes precise measurements of the person’s face. That measurement is then compared to a database of individuals, each with their own recorded measurements. The tech is reportedly able to determine a match within seconds. For riders, the police want to make sure the person on the train/plane isn’t traveling with someone else’s ID or hopping a train/plane to avoid police. Catching criminals in a real world crowd just with a glance.  In the last years, more and more wearable devices are being adapted for law enforcement. Next-generation wearables have the potential to enable police officers to improve situational awareness and decision making during missions. Law enforcement needs real-time information for better situational awareness in the field and at the command center. Officers need access to information, to stream videos and to collaborate in real time.

[browsersec](https://github.com/Amrt1n3zm/browsersec): Browser Security Handbook Written and maintained by Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@google.com>. Copyright 2008, 2009 Google Inc, rights reserved. Released under terms and conditions of the CC-3.0-BY license. Table of Contents → Part 1: Basic concepts behind web browsers → Part 2: Standard browser security features → Part 3: Experimental and legacy security mechanisms Introduction Hello, and welcome to the Browser Security Handbook! This document is meant to provide web application developers, browser engineers, and information security researchers with a one-stop reference to key security properties of contemporary web browsers. Insufficient understanding of these often poorly-documented characteristics is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of several classes of security vulnerabilities. Although all browsers implement roughly the same set of baseline features, there is relatively little standardization - or conformance to standards - when it comes to many of the less apparent implementation details. Furthermore, vendors routinely introduce proprietary tweaks or improvements that may interfere with existing features in non-obvious ways, and seldom provide a detailed discussion of potential problems. The current version of this document is based on the following versions of web browsers: | Browser | Version | Test date | Usage* | Notes | |:--------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------| | Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 | 6.0.2900.5512 | Feb 2, 2009 | 16% | | | Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 | 7.0.5730.11 | Dec 11, 2008 | 11% | | | Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 | 8.0.6001.18702 | Sep 7, 2010 | 28% | | | Mozilla Firefox 2 | 2.0.0.18 | Nov 28, 2008 | 1% | | | Mozilla Firefox 3 | 3.6.8 | Sep 7, 2010 | 22% | | | Apple Safari | 4.0 | Jun 10, 2009 | 5% | | | Opera | 9.62 | Nov 18, 2008 | 2% | | | Google Chrome | 7.0.503.0 | Sep 7, 2010 | 8% | | | Android embedded browser | SDK 1.5 R3 | Oct 3, 2009 | n/a | | * Approximate browser usage data based on public Net Applications estimates for August 2010. Disclaimers and typographical conventions Please note that although we tried to make this document as accurate as possible, some errors might have slipped through. Use this document only as an initial reference, and independently verify any characteristics you wish to depend upon. Test cases for properties featured in this document are freely available for download. The document attempts to capture the risks and security considerations present for general populace of users accessing the web with default browser settings in place. Although occasionally noted, the degree of flexibility offered through non-standard settings is by itself not a subject of this comparative study. Through the document, red color is used to bring attention to browser properties that seem particularly tricky or unexpected, and need to be carefully accounted for in server-side implementations. Whenever status quo appears to bear no significant security consequences and is well-understood, but a particular browser implementation takes additional steps to protect application developers, we use green color to denote this, likewise. Rest assured, neither of these color codes implies that a particular browser is less or more secure than its counterparts. Acknowledgments Browser Security Handbook would not be possible without the ideas and assistance from the following contributors: Filipe Almeida Brian Eaton Chris Evans Drew Hintz Nick Kralevich Marko Martin Tavis Ormandy Wladimir Palant David Ross Marius Schilder Parisa Tabriz Julien Tinnes Berend-Jan Wever Mike Wiacek The document builds on top of previous security research by Adam Barth, Collin Jackson, Amit Klein, Jesse Ruderman, and many other security experts who painstakingly dissected browser internals for the past few years.
