## DISTCC - AUTOMAKE
Add module to set the right environment for using Distcc
Ex:
export PATH="/usr/lib/ccache/bin:/usr/lib/distcc/bin:${PATH}"

## Advanced Machine Learning
✅ Add cybersecurity machine learning module for code vulnerability detection
- Enhance model training with pre-trained embeddings
- Add support for more programming languages
- Create visualization dashboard for security findings
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline tools
